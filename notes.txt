make 16 divs using JS inside an html container div
    make function that creates a new grid of divs
        function(number of divs, space)
            space / number of divs = space for each div
            for number of divs, create div with dimensions above inside container

Make sure the divs are in a grid, use flexbox for that

set up a hover effect that leaves a trail of colored pixels where the mouse has been
add a button that clears the grid and replaces it with n new divs where n is the number entered that take up the same space, limit 100
